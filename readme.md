Tally is a simple, unobtrusive, design‐led JavaScript template engine for Node.js and browsers.

**Currently in alpha and under heavy development.** You can play around with it but there is very little documentation and the APIs might change.

Tally extends the excellent [Distal template engine](https://code.google.com/p/distal/) which is an implementation of the [Template Attribute Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_Attribute_Language) (TAL) concept from [Zope](http://www.zope.org).
